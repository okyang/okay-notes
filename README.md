# okay-notes
Just some notes I take while I learn about software development tools. They're okay. Okay notes.

- [ **Intro to Ansible Notes**](./intro_to_ansible/README.md)
- [ **Install a MQTT Broker on a Raspberry Pi**](./mqtt_broker_on_raspberry_pi/README.md) - Setup a MQTT Broker and experiment sending and receiving MQTT messages.
- [ ****React** Intro**](./react_intro/README.md) - Creating a bad fitness workout app with react and typescript. It's bad, but it's for learning purposes.
- [**Raspberry Pi Nas**](./raspi_nas/) - Create a network attached storage or NAS using a Raspberry Pi.
